# MongoDB Batch Size (Optional)
# Number of operations to send to MongoDB in each batch upload
# Default: 10000 operations per batch
# Adjust based on available system RAM:
# - Lower values (e.g., 5000) for systems with 4-8GB RAM
# - Default (10000) works well for systems with 8-16GB RAM
# - Higher values (e.g., 20000) for systems with 16GB+ RAM
# MONGO_BATCH_SIZE=10000
